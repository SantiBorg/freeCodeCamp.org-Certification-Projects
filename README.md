# freeCodeCamp.org Certification Projects

This repo is for the freeCodeCamp.org certification projects, they have no copyright as it is inteded by its creators, i created this repo to learn and get
in touch with the functionality and usage of GitHub.

Warning!
This repo stores all the solutions to the exercises of all the projects that i do in the freecodecamp.org page, so if you are student in any of their courses
think before you check the code in this repo if you want to solve the exercises or the projects all by yourself, otherwise SPOILERS AHEAD!

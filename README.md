# freeCodeCamp.org Certification Projects

This repo is for the free code camp certification projects, they have no copyright as it is inteded by its creators, i created this repo to learn and get
in touch with the functionality and usage of GitHub.

Warning!
This repo stores the solutions to all of the exercises and projects that i do in the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) page, so
if you are student in any of their courses think before you check the code in this repo, if you really want to solve the exercises or the projects
all by yourself, otherwise SPOILERS AHEAD!

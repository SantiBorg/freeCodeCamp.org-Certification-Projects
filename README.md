# freeCodeCamp.org Certification Projects

This repo is for the freeCodeCamp certification projects, the code in it has no copyright as it is inteded by its creators, i created this repo to
learn and get in touch with the functionality and usage of GitHub, in a more practical and self-taught way and
i may DELETE it in the near future when i don't need it any more.

Warning!
This repo stores the solutions to all of the exercises and projects that i do in the [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) website, so
if you are student in any of their courses think before you check any of the code in this repo, if you really want to solve the exercises or the projects
all by yourself, otherwise SPOILERS AHEAD!
